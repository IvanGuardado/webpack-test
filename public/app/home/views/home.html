<h1>Welcome to this webpack test!</h1>
<p>Select one of the page sections to load each of them asynchronosly. Instead of creating a big bundle with all the code or loading each file by separated this solution creates a chunk build for each whole section. This way you could have a wating time whenever you move to a different section but the transitions inside of it are fast becuase all code is already loaded.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Developer Tools</strong> and watch the Network tranfer.</p>
